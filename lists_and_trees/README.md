"Film cast": an implementation of doubly linked list data structure and functionalities, such as: adding, removing, searching for an actor and finding the best actor suited for the given role (fulfilling given criteria).

"Monkeys": creating a tree structure by the given rules and displaying monkeys in a preorder way.

"RPN": implements converting infix notation to reverse Polish notation and then calculates the result for RPN form using self-implemented queue and stack; also checks whether brackets are correctly placed; this implementation uses redundant code duplication for implementing queue and stack for different types, it should have used templates instead.
